Customer Segmentation and Lookalike Model
This repository contains the implementation of customer segmentation using clustering techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer transactions, and a lookalike model to recommend similar customers.

Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

EDA_Business_Insights.pdf: A report summarizing business insights derived from exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Clustering_Results_Report.pdf: A report detailing the results of customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
FirstName_LastName_EDA.py: A Python script containing the code for performing EDA on the provided dataset and generating insights.
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike_Model.py: A Python script for building and executing the lookalike model, which recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.py: A Python script for performing customer segmentation using clustering algorithms and calculating relevant metrics (e.g., Davies-Bouldin Index).
Tasks
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Perform EDA on the provided dataset and derive at least 5 business insights.
Deliverables:
EDA_Business_Insights.pdf with business insights based on the analysis.
Python script for the EDA process.
Task 2: Lookalike Model
Goal: Build a lookalike model that takes a user's profile as input and recommends 3 similar customers.
Deliverables:
A Python script for developing the lookalike model.
A CSV file Lookalike.csv containing the top 3 lookalikes and their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Goal: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques and calculate the Davies-Bouldin Index.
Deliverables:
Clustering_Results_Report.pdf summarizing the clustering results, number of clusters, DB Index, and other metrics.
A Python script implementing the clustering model and visualizing the results.
